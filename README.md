# Weston-App

CSPROJECTWESTON is a project to show the status of establishments in the city of Weston, Florida.

## Overview

Welcome to development! This project I hope can either introduce or further your knowledge of development. I created some documents to make sure everyone is on the same page. If you already experienced in development, feel free to skip reading them. However, I ask that everyone looks at [the rules for the master branch](media/Rules-For-Master-Branch.md).

Make sure you communicate with your teams to organize the work.

I'll delete this overview section and clean up the project for distribution when production is finished.
