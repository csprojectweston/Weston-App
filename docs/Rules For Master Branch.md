# Rules for the Master Branch

The master branch of the project is where the code for the project will be stored. Anyone can __clone__, or copy the code at any time. For more information, see the [GitHub 101 page](https://github.com/csprojectweston/Weston-App/blob/master/docs/GitHub%20101.md).

## Rules

1. Make sure the portion of code you are working on doesn't conflict with anyone else on your team.
2. Don't touch any code from another part of the project unless granted permission.
3. Please do not touch any of the Documents, especially the README. If you want to suggest a change, contact me.
4. You can commit large or small chunks of progress/code
5. Try and be as descriptive as possible in your commit message. You don't need to write a paragraph, but for example if you cleaned up the front-end code write `Cleaned up the front-end code in example.html and example.js`
6. Make sure the code works
7. No, seriously make sure it works. Test your code inside and out before committing.
