# List of tasks that need to be finished:

TODO is a convention commonly used in developing to show that a segment of code needs to be implemented still. The tasks to be finished will be listed here, and crossed off after completion.

## Front-End

* List each business in Weston under categories (restaurants, shopping, etc.)
  * Use dummy data as the actual data will be later implemented by the back-end team.
    * Ex: shopping1, mall1, resturant1, resturant2
  * You'll be given an html list `<ul>` of the establishments with HTML classes relating to their purpose
    * Ex: `<li class='ResturantEntry'> McDonalds </li>`
* Render the categories on the website
* Implement the navigable map displaying the restaurants
* Hook the map up to the data
* Clean up the UI
  * Make the business list appear in a convenient location
  * Make the map neat and intuitive
* Make the page RESPONSIVE

## Back-End

* Find a way to collect all the businesses in Weston
* Scrape the data for all the businesses in Weston, including
  * Open hours
  * Holidays, Events, etc.
  * Prices
* Merge the front-end files with the back-end framework
* Use actual data instead of the dummy data
