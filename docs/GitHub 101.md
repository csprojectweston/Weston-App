# GitHub 101

Everything you need to know about GitHub to work on this project.

## What is GitHub?

At the core, GitHub is simply a web platform used to host code. Your code is stored in an online __repository__ Others can view, copy, and contribute to your repository, which is what makes it so useful and robust. I'll define some terms you should know. You don't have to bother with the specifics as they aren't important to this project, but you could always go to the internet if you want to learn more.

## Important Terms

* __Repository__
  * A repository is a place to store code. 
  * Can be local or remote.
  * Shows every change, modification, and previous versions of the code. You can always rollback changes.

* __Clone__
  * Cloning is making a copy of another repository and storing it somewhere, either on your hard drive or your GitHub account.
  * Cloning allows you to modify and contribute to the original source code.

* __add__
  * Adding is preparing your files to be committed to a repository.
* __Commit__
  * Committing is adding changes to a _local_ repository.
  * If you modified the file `example.html`, you would have to commit your changes to the repository.
  * You have to add a message when you commit.

* __push__
  * Pushing is adding changes to a _remote_ repository.

* __pull__
  * Pulling is updating your _local_ repository to the _remote_ repository. If someone made changes on the remote repository, you would pull the remote repository to update your local repository.
  * Issues are caused if a file on the remote repository and local repository are both changed.

* __branch__
  * A branch is a named part of the repository that has unique changes. The master branch is often the only and most important branch.
  * You create a branch by forking another branch.
